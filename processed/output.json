Higher the risks, the higher the annual premium. Apart\nfrom this, there are several other factors that determine the premium for\ngroup health insurance.\nBelow mentioned isa list of major factors that can influence the premium paid\nby the employer tothe insurance company.\nThe typeofplan you choose\nIna group health 1 E-Employee only\ninsurance plan,\nyou have the 2 ESC-Employee, spouseand children\noption of choosing EsC- Employee, spouse, children, parents orin-laws\nThe premium increases according tothe increase in the dependent members.\nForinstance, the premium paid towards the ESCP plan will be higher than the E-only\nplan as there are fewer lives covered.\nThe sum insured\nThe sum insured is the maximum amount theinsurer will pay the policyholder in\ncase ofany unforeseen events.You can choose this based on thetype ofhospital\nyour employees choose, the number ofdependents covered, etc. You can choose\nthesum insured from as low as Rs 10,00,000 ormore.\npozcare\nNature ofjob\nThe type ofjob also influences the premium foryour corporate health insurance\npolicy. If the health risk associated with your job is high, then the premiums you pay\ntowards the plan may also increase.\nAdd-onsopted\nThe concept ofhealth insurance is changing dynamically. Today companies want\ntooffer something that not only pays your medical bills but also covers other\nhealth-related expenses. Now, these benefits are add-ons in an insurance policy.\nYou can choose additions to your group health insurance plan like maternity\ninsurance, health and wellness programs, dental insurance, doctor consultations,\nroom rent capping, and many more. Your premiums increase based on theadd\nons you choose.\nClaim history\nIf you\nare\npurchasing group health insurance forthe first time foryour organization,\nthen you need notworry about this. However, if you are not new to purchasinga\ngroup health insurance plan foryour team, then your insurer may look atthe claim\nhistory you had in the past to decide your premium.\nIn case, you havea higher number ofclaims raised in the previous financial year,\nthen it may\nlead to slightly higher premiums forthenext financial year.\nAverage age ofemployees\nAccording tothe insurer, as the age increases, the medical risks associated with\nthe employees go up.\nSo your insurance company raises the premium tocompensate fortherisks.\nAccording tothis,a company witha younger workforce where theaverage age of\nemployees is between 20 to30 may pay lesser premiums than the ones with an\naverage age of45.\n@ pozcare\nComparegroup\nhealth insurance\nHow to choosethebestgroup\nhealth insurance foremployees?\nThere aremore than 20 health insurance companies in India and all of them\noffer varied types ofgroup mediclaim insurance.

These\n6 arethesignificant parameters you would need tocompare two group\nhealth insurance policies.\nCoverageand sum-insured\nHealth insurance costs are inflating at the rate of 17-20% annually. You have to\nconsider the coverage and sum insured that is offered in the market and match it.\nOfferinga sum insured of1 to2 lakhs won't make thecutthese days. The average\nis3\nto 5 lakhs.\nYou have tooffer extensive coverage with reasonable sub-limits or no sub—limits,\nno copay, maternity cover, and also free doctor consultations.\n@ pozcare\nClaim settlement ratio\nClaim settlement ratio determines how many claims are settled by the insurer\nyearly. Always go fora company that hasa good claim settlement ratio.A claim\nsettlement ratio above 80% is good.\nThe claim settlement ratio directly impacts your claim experience.

They arethemiddlemen\nbetween you and theinsurer. They help you with filing, tracking claims and getting\nthe right information regarding your policy.\nIn some cases, insurers don't work with TPA and instead have an in-house claim\nsettlement department. So, always check if the plan has an external TPA or an\nin-house TPA forclaim settlements\nNetworkhospitals\nNetwork hospitals are the hospitals that are tied up with the insurer for cashless\nclaims. The more thenumber ofhospitals, the better foryour employees. Cashless\nclaims enablea seamless and time-efficient claims process. And cashless claims\nare only possible in network hospitals.\npozcare\nIncurred claim ratio\nIncurred Claim Ratio or ICR is one of the factors that determine the credibility of an\ninsurance company andis also an important factor to check before comparing two\nhealth insurance companies.\nWhile taking Incurred Claim Ratio into account, check fortheaverage Incurred\nClaim Ratio of all health insurance companies and go fortheone that is closest to\nthis average.\nIncurred claim ratio is calculated as\nIncurred claim ratio or ICR = Amount settled as claims/Amount collected as premiums\nCustomerexperience\npozcare\nConsult, compareandinsure\nAt Pazcare, we offeryoua consulting\napproach foryour group health insurance\npolicy.
